    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my portfolio! Let me introduce myself, I'm Jordan Picton, I'm a front-end web developer based within
      Hartlepool, County Durham, UK. I'm currently working on projects that will allow me to gain knowledge with also
      showing off my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a love for learning new technologies and being able to see the code turn into something that can be
      useable, helpful or even enjoyable. With that being said I will also post other projects here that are not website
      related.
